# Mingo’s Video Game History

I’ve played lots of video games in my life, but these are the ones that stuck. Most I finished, all of them I remember fondly and have sentimental value, like a good film or book.

| Released | Game | Platform | Played |
-----------|------|----------|---------
| 1988 | **Pinball Construction Set**<br />Make my _own_ pinball machine?! I truly live in the future now! | Mac | 1991 |
| 1988 | **Shufflepuck Café**<br />Hours and hours of flinging my mouse across the desk. | Mac | 1991 |
| 1989 | **Chip’s Challenge**<br />Loved playing this game at my childhood friend Daniel. | Lynx | 1991 |
| 1989 | **Final Fight**<br/>Co-op with my best mate. | Arcade | |
| 1989 | **Pipe Dream**<br />Not many games ran on the Classic, but this, Shufflepuck and MS Flight Simulator kept me busy. | Mac | 1991 |
| 1990 | **Looney Tunes**<br />Loved the animations and smooth game play, not too challenging though. | GB | |
| 1990 | **Revenge of the Gator**<br />Great physics and I've always had a week spot for pinball games. | GB | |
| 1990 | **Super Mario Land**<br />If I close my eyes and think of video games, I hear this Mario music playing, not the NES one. | GB | |
| 1990 | **Tetris**<br />This should probably be on my moms list, because this game drained so many batteries over night after I went to bed. | GB | |
| 1991 | **Blades of Steel**<br />Icing!! What the hell is an icing? I have no clue. Best sports game of my youth. | GB | |
| 1991 | **Microsoft Flight Simulator 4.0**<br />I regularly flew from Chicago to New York City in real time at 5 fps on a Mac Classic, what did you do with your childhood? | Mac | |
| 1991 | **PGA Tour Golf**<br />Gaming on a Mac, you take what you can get. Putting and choosing the right golf-rod (that's the term, right?) was my favorite part. | Mac | |
| 1991 | **SimCity**<br />Building the smallest viable self sustaining cities, in hind sight, was a good challenge for my web-dev career later on. | Mac | |
| 1991 | **Todd’s Adventures in Slime World**<br />Beautiful graphics (is what I remember, I don't dare to look up a screenshot) | Lynx | |
| 1992 | **Days of Thunder**<br />The first racing game I loved, though that might go to an MS-DOS title of which I only remember that it came on a 5¼" disk and that it had to run in Hercules mode. | GB | |
| 1992 | **Street Fighter II**<br />I was the best street fighter in school, don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Signature move: M.Bison's Psycho Crusher | Arcade | |
| 1992 | **Wolfenstein 3D**<br />Played this first at my friends house (in a tiny postage stamp of a screen inside a screen). | PC | |
| 1993 | **Spectre Supreme**<br />Got this on a MacFormat disk, it felt fast and difficult, but really cool to learn how to get your bearings in a 3d virtual world. | Mac | |
| 1994 | **Marathon**<br />Made _so many_ maps for these, all lost to time. | Mac | 1995 |
| 1994 | **Wolfenstein 3D**<br />Also loved making maps for wolf3d when it came out for Macintosh. | Mac | 1996 |
| 1995 | **Lemmings**<br />Just, fun. | Mac | |
| 1995 | **Star Wars: Dark Forces**<br />Fondest memories of a Star Wars game for me. | Mac | |
| 1995 | **The Need for Speed**<br />Played this at my cousins' on their beast of a PC. I remember loving the cops and robbers aspect of it. | PC | |
| 1996 | **Escape Velocity**<br />Great music, sound effects and super smooth graphics, spent so many nights in space exploring, fighting and trading. | Mac | |
| 1997 | **FIFA: Road to World Cup 98**<br />I remember this looking _exactly_ like watching football on TV. No I will not lookup a youtube video to verify if it still looks that way. | PC | |
| 1998 | **Gran Turismo**<br />Speaking of ultra realistic graphics, such a beautiful game. I bought my PlayStation just for this game. Favorite track: Clubman Stage R5 | PSX | |
| 1998 | **Metal Gear Sold**<br />Hideo Kojima got me. I shouldn't like these kinds of games, I don't like third person, but I couldn't put it down. I still vividly remember the sniper level and the rumble in the controller shaking you out of control if you didn't take diazepam in time. | PSX | |
| 1999 | **Driver**<br />Game changer. So much freedom in a game and with these graphics! It felt like being in a movie. | PSX | |
| 1999 | **Half Life**<br />LAN parties at the office. We networked (it was a different time) our office together with that of another company in the same building and played every Friday 'till late. | PC | |
| 1999 | **Quake 2**<br />Same as Half Life, played this almost exclusively at the office, railgunning everyone in milliseconds. | PC | |
| 1999 | **Unreal Tournament**<br />Different game, different office, same story. This time though, a new generation was fragging me in milliseconds though :) | PC | 2007 |
| 2000 | **SSX**<br />I was not expecting to have this much fun in a game with snowboarding as subject. Loved the off-piste map "Untracked". Great sense of speed, great music integration. | PS2 | |
| 2000 | **Star Trek: Voyager - Elite Force**<br />The only (?) good Star Trek FPS. | Mac | |
| 2001 | **Advance Wars**<br />Only strategy I ever got into, and only 14 years after its release | GBA | 2015 |
| 2001 | **Grand Theft Auto 3**<br />Like Driver, but you can get out off your car! Amazing game,  | PS2 | |
| 2001 | **Star Wars: Starfighter**<br />Goes into the category, SSX, Looney Tunes: easy, simple smooth game play. | PS2 | |
| 2002 | **Medal of Honor: Allied Assault**<br />Best in the MoH series, as far as I'm concerned. Few years after Quake 2 my love for the FPS genre really kicked off here. | PC | |
| 2002 | **The Getaway**<br />Not a native of London, but I've been there a few times and those visits actually helped me navigate this game. Also, great story and really liked the gameplay. | PS2 | |
| 2004 | **Half-Life 2**<br />I remember being really impressed with the physics of the power lines in the game. Still have the occasional nightmare filled with the sound effects of HL2 | PC | |
| 2005 | **Battlefield 2**<br />Long time my favorite Battlefield game, until BF3 came out. Played this mostly against bots, though. | PC | |
| 2005 | **Gran Turismo 4**<br />I remember this as the best in the series, but that could just be nostalgia. | PS2 | |
| 2007 | **Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare**<br />I'm noticing a lot of (I think) pivotal games on my list, Wolfenstein 3D, FIFA '98, GTA and now CoD4. I never got into the online aspect of CoD, but I loved the single player on-rails campaigns. | PS3 | |
| 2008 | **Far Cry 2**<br />I don't think a lot of people liked this game, but I really liked the setting and specific mechanics chosen to make things feel more realistic. Also, the map making feature was pretty great. | PS3 | |
| 2008 | **Grand Theft Auto IV**<br />I feel like this is about where big improvements in graphics stopped. And this, at the time of writing, is already 10 years ago! | PS3 | |
| 2008 | **Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots**<br />I should try MGS2 and 3 one day, but this was the first time since '98 that I amassed enough courage to begin a Hideo game. And he gives me fried eggs? This guy. | PS3 | |
| 2008 | **Mirrors Edge**<br />Another game about a sport I have 0 feelings for, but the design attracted me to buying it. It then completely convinced me with how well it feels to play. | PS3 | |
| 2010 | **Inside** | Switch | 2023 |
| 2010 | **Minecraft**<br />Bought basically sight unseen on October 2nd, 2010 on a tip my coworker gave me. Still love exploring and building things every now and then | PC | |
| 2010 | **Red Dead Redemption**<br />First (and only) game where I teared up. Everything is in this game. | PS3 | |
| 2011 | **Battlefield 3**<br />I put close to 2000 hours into this one. If you see me near a PC with BF3 installed, pull me away. | PC | |
| 2012 | **Journey** | LeGo | 2023 |
| 2013 | **Grand Theft Auto V**<br />The last game I got really into. It's been 11 years already, time for a new one. | PS3, PC, LeGo | |
| 2016 | **Firewatch** | PC | 2016 |
| 2016 | **Limbo** | Switch | 2023 |
| 2020 | **Factorio** | PC | 2021 |
| 2022 | **Stray** | LeGo | 2023 |
