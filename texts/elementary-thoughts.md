# Elementary.io OS



## First (and second) impressions

### Good

- great default looks
- I live mostly in cross platform programs and they truly are, I feel no different working in those than I do on other platforms.
- The really great thing of course is that I have a \*nix layer underneath it all

### Fine/expected

- most things just work (incl. hardware stuff like wifi, bt, fans, vendor specific keys)
- no crashes

### Annoying

- defaults to single click to open files/programs

### Bad

- missing settings for things like that single click mentioned above (or I haven't found them, which in itself would be bad)



## Verdict

- So far so good, still not _loving_ Linux's lack of polish in general (each program has their own designer and since this is all open source, often they are designed by the programmer). But, Elementary comes closest to how I like things to look and feel. Closer than Windows 10. Not as close as macOS.
