title       | Mingo.nl: Hosted on 2 LEGO mounted Raspberry Pis

#Hosted on Pi

This website is hosted on two Raspberry Pis, running Raspbian, Nginx, Tomcat 7 and [Lucee](http://lucee.org "A light-weight dynamic scripting language for the JVM").
They are configured to balance the load between the two.
