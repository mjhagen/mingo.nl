#Welcome to Mingo’s Very Basic Website

I was born in [Amsterdam](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mjhagen/sets/72157603751553424/ "Mingo’s Amsterdam set on Flickr.") in 1978. My girlfriend is [Hanneke](http://hannekekijkt.nl/ "Website of Hanneke Meijers of Hanneke Kijkt."), she has a [Circus](http://tent.eu "TENT Circus Theater Productions").<br />
I am CTO and owner of [E-Line Websolutions](http://e-linewebsolutions.nl/ "E-Line Websolutions’ website.") where I mainly program in [CFML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ColdFusion_Markup_Language "ColdFusion Markup Language"), I'm also an admin for the [CFML Slack](http://cfml-slack.herokuapp.com "Let’s talk about ColdFusion and Lucee").

I’ll let you know what I’m up to via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mjhagen/ "Follow @mjhagen on Twitter.").<br />
I post my photos to [Instagram](https://instagram.com/mjhagen/ "See Mingo’s photos on Instagram.") and [Flickr](https://flickr.com/photos/mjhagen/ "See Mingo’s photos on Flickr."), sometimes they even get [published](/flickr "See Mingo’s published photographs.").<br />
I’m completely adicted to [Video Games](/games "List of my favorite video games.") and the music I listen to is scrobbled to [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/mhagen "Mingo’s favorite music posted to Last.fm.").

This website is hosted on my [LEGO Pi Rack](/pi "Page showing how this website is hosted.").
