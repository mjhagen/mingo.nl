#Welcome to Mingo’s Very Basic Website

I was born in [Amsterdam](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mjhagen/sets/72157603751553424/ "Mingo’s Amsterdam set on Flickr.") in 1978.
My girlfriend is [Hanneke](https://hannekekijkt.nl/ "Website of Hanneke Meijers of Hanneke Kijkt."),
she has a [Circus](https://tent.eu "TENT Circus Theater Productions") where I occasionally work as a sound technician.

By day I work for [E-Trias Ingenieurs](https://e-trias.nl/ "E-Trias’ website.") and [E-Line Websolutions](https://e-line.nl "E-Line's website.") where I maintain servers and develop software.

By night I tinker away at my collection of old [Apple stuff](/apple.cfm "List of my Apple devices.")
of which I also post photos as [VintageMacDude](https://instagram.com/vintagemacdude/ "Mingo’s other Instagram account").

I’ll let you know what I’m up to via
[Mastodon](https://oldbytes.space/@mingo "Follow @mingo@oldbytes.space on Mastodon." rel="me") and
[Instagram](https://instagram.com/mjhagen/ "Mingo’s Instagram account" rel="me").

I've listed a few [video games](/games.cfm "List of my favorite video games.") I loved playing
and most music I listen to gets scrobbled to [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/mhagen "Mingo’s favorite music posted to Last.fm.").
