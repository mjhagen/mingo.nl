#Welcome to Mingo’s Very Basic Website

<!-- {strava} -->

I was born in [Amsterdam](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mjhagen/sets/72157603751553424/ "Mingo’s Amsterdam set on Flickr.") in 1978.
My girlfriend is [Hanneke](http://hannekekijkt.nl/ "Website of Hanneke Meijers of Hanneke Kijkt."),
she has a [Circus](http://tent.eu "TENT Circus Theater Productions").

By day I am the CTO and co-owner of [E-Line Websolutions](http://e-linewebsolutions.nl/ "E-Line Websolutions’ website.")
where I mainly program in [CFML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ColdFusion_Markup_Language "ColdFusion Markup Language"),
I’m also an admin for the [CFML Slack](http://cfml-slack.herokuapp.com "Let’s talk about ColdFusion and Lucee").

By night I tinker away at my collection of old [Apple stuff](/apple.cfm "List of my Apple devices.")
of which I also post photos as [VintageMacDude](https://instagram.com/vintagemacdude/ "Mingo’s other Instagram account").

I’ll let you know what I’m up to via
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/mjhagen/ "Follow @mjhagen on Twitter." rel="me"),
[Micro.blog](https://mjhagen.micro.blog "Follow @mjhagen on Micro.blog" rel="me"),
and
[Instagram](https://instagram.com/mjhagen/ "Mingo’s Instagram account" rel="me").

I've listed a few [video games](/games.cfm "List of my favorite video games.") I loved playing
and most music I listen to gets scrobbled to [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/mhagen "Mingo’s favorite music posted to Last.fm.").
